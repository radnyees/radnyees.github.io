I am a MSc. Psychology student at Loughborough University. I have a previous background in working with Neurodevelopmental and Neurodegenerative disorders through various internships during my undergrad. Having a Masters degree in Business Psychology right now, I am aiming to pursue a career in the field of Neuroscience. My goal is to pursue a PhD in Neuroscience, and I am currently looking for potential research opportunities.

At the moment, I am working on my MATLAB and Python skills and exploring more on the project on my mind [MyastheniaGravis and Brain-Computer Interfaces](https://radnyees.substack.com/p/myasthenia-gravis-and-brain-computer).

Please feel free to contact me for any opportunities. [sarvadnyar21@gmail.com](mailto:sarvadnyar21@gmail.com)
